## **UXD - User Experience Design**

A large part of inspiration behind the planning for this project came from Jason James Garretts’s, “The Elements of User-Experience”. By keeping the user in mind throughout the design and development of the project, it would be easier to make the user experience a positive one. For the user to have a positive emotional response throughout the project.

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes,

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## **The Strategy Plane**

### **Creator Goals**
- As a creator, I wasnt the site to be easy to navigate.
- As a creator, I want user to be able to filter through products, either by name, price.
- As a creator, I want to provide users with updates to any actions.
- As a creator, I want to allows admins to Add/Edit/Delete products to/from the store.

### **User Stories**

#### **Regular Site User Stories**
- As a site user, I want the main purpose of the site to be clear, so that I can determine if this the correct 
site for me.
- As a site user, I want to be able to navigate across the site, so that I can view different pages on the site. 
- As a site user, I want to be able to sign up, so that I can have a personal account on the site.
- As a site user, I want to be able to receive an email confirmation after registering, so that I can verify 
that my account registration was successful.

#### **Customer Shopper Stories**
- As a shopper, I want to be to view all products, so that I can decide what I want to buy.
- As a shopper, I want to be able to view products in more detail.
- As a shopper, I want to be able to view reviews left by other customers for products, so that I can understand whether the product is worth purchasing. 
- As a shopper, I want to be able to see a confirmation when a product is added to my shopping bag, so that I can avoid accidentally adding multiple quantities of the same item. 
- As a shopper, I want to be able to view my bag, so that I can see what is in my bag and adjust quantities

#### **Customers (Logged in) Stories**
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to save my details, so that I can avoid retyping my details again.
- As a logged in user, I want to have my past orders viewable, so that I can verify what my past order was and view the order number.
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to leave reviews on product, so that other users may be able to benefit from my opinions on my purchase. 
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to edit my reviews, so that I am able to amend any errors or incase I change my opinion.
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to add products to my wishlist, so that I can view those products later.
- As a logged in user, I was to be able to remove products from my wishlist, so that my wishlist is only full of products I want saved.

My user stories were obtained by doing research into other stores and seeing how their sites ran. Argos in particular helped me to guage what I would need to implement and what potentially could be left out or moved into a phase for later deployment.

## **The Scope Plane**

The features that I had thought about before designing the project and my deadline was not achievable. I opted for a phased release approach. 

I was able to ascertain which features were more important and should be working on my initial deployment, and which features I could add later.

My plan for a phased deployment, 

**Phase 1**
- A project that would satisfy my user stories.
    - Home Page with a introduction 
    - Navbar allowing user to navigate to different pages
    - Products page allowing users to view all products. 
    - A product detail page.
    - E-commerce functionality allowing user to make purchases.
**Phase 2**
- Building upon the Phase 1 project with additional features.
    - A funtional blog app that allows admins to to post blogs.
    - Allow users the filter blog types.
    - Allow users to post comments on the blogs.
**Phase 3**
- My final planned phase would focus on user feedback
    - Project feedback, to see if things could be improved.

## **The Structure Plane**

#### **Colors**
![Color pallete used through the project](https://github.com/Harry-Leepz/Nourish-and-Lift/blob/main/docs/images/color-pallete.png "Color Pallete")

#212121
- I used a dark grey for the body color, I have always preferred darkmode and thought it helped the lighter colors stand out, creating a better contrast.

#17A2B8
- The Bootstrap info class colors was used most on horizontal rules, buttons and anchortag elements. 

#FAFAFA
- Offwhite color was used for the text throughout the project. I felt it's softer of the eyes over default white, and compliments the blue and dark grey really well.

#484848
- A slightly lighter shade of grey was mainly used on the Bootstrap toasts as a background. I choose this, so it's easier for the user to view the toasts and descern the difference between elements overlapping.

#### **Fonts**

Google Fonts - Quicksand
- I chose Quicksand as my font throughout the project. The font is easily readible and simple. I opted to have a single font in this project simply because the project as whole isn't text heavy, and chose to instead to use a heavier font weight for headings.

#### **Images**

My images over the course of the project did manage to evolve and develop thanks to Sonia Akhtar Hussain.
My defualy images for the product had white background, and Sonia used her skills to really base the products stand out with a custom background.

#### **Database Design**

SQLite was used during development and then Heroku Postgres in production.
