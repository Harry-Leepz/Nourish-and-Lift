## **Introduction**
Welcome to Nourish and Lift.

Nourish and Lift is my fourth and final project, part of the Code Institute, Full Stack Web Developer Course.

## **UXD - User Experience Design**

A large part of inspiration behind the planning for this project came from Jason James Garretts’s, “The Elements of User-Experience”. By keeping the user in mind throughout the design and development of the project, it would be easier to make the user experience a positive one. For the user to have a positive emotional response throughout the project.

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes,

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

- As a shopper, I want to be able to view reviews left by other customers for products, so that I can understand whether the product is worth purchasing. 
- As a shopper, I want to be able to see a confirmation when a product is added to my shopping bag, so that I can avoid accidentally adding multiple quantities of the same item. 
- As a shopper, I want to be able to view my bag, so that I can see what is in my bag and adjust quantities

#### **Customers (Logged in) Stories**
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to save my details, so that I can avoid retyping my details again.
- As a logged in user, I want to have my past orders viewable, so that I can verify what my past order was and view the order number.
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to leave reviews on product, so that other users may be able to benefit from my opinions on my purchase. 
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to edit my reviews, so that I am able to amend any errors or incase I change my opinion.
- As a logged in user, I want to be able to add products to my wishlist, so that I can view those products later.
- As a logged in user, I was to be able to remove products from my wishlist, so that my wishlist is only full of products I want saved.

My user stories were obtained by doing research into other stores and seeing how their sites ran. Argos in particular helped me to guage what I would need to implement and what potentially could be left out or moved into a phase for later deployment.
